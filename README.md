This branch is aimed to add support for Google Drive via ocamlfuse.

This image depends on **[amitie10g/docker-gdrive](https://cloud.docker.com/u/amitie10g/repository/docker/amitie10g/docker-gdrive)**, based on the [Alessandro Strada's](https://github.com/astrada) [google-drive-ocamlfuse](https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse) project.
